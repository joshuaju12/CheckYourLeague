# CheckYourLeague

CheckYourLeague is an application utilizing Riot Games' API to provide and display useful game metrics for League of Legends. <br /> 
Inspired heavily by [op.gg](https://www.op.gg/), CheckYourLeague displays information such as win rates, recently games played, individual match details, and rank statistics. <br />
Other additional features include being able to search other players through a search bar or upon clicking on a player's name.
